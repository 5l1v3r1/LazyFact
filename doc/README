LazyFact - Factoring RSA moduli using crazy luck

First it will try to use simple methods:
- like trial division
- Pollards rho
- Shanks squares

Then it goes over to just generating an insane amount of moduli in the hope that one will have a prime factor in common with the modulus you're trying to factor.



	Usage

$ cd src
$ make
$ ./lazyfact <modulus>
